What navigation outputs to Arduino:

Output of navigation (from Odroid to Arduino):
x_goal, y_goal, theta_goal
x_robot, y_robot, theta_robot
#x is the coordinate in x direction i.e. pointing from zone 1 to zone 2.
#y is the coordinate in y direction i.e. pointing from zone 1 to zone 3.
#theta is the orientation angle of the robot with respect to the x-axis.

Input of navigation:
3 angles of the triangulation of yellow-blue, blue-red and red-yellow (from Raspberry)
x, y, theta from the encoders (from Arduino)

IMU-data if necessary (magnetometer) (gyroscope?)
Bumpers if necessary


function:
merge triangulation with odometry (kalman filter) to get final position estimation
